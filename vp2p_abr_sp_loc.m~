%% vp2p_abr_sp_loc.m
% 
% Find locations of the maximum peak and minimum trough in coherent average
% ABR trace that were used to calculate maximum peak-to-peak voltage.
%
% Assumptions:
% Peak to peak voltage is defined as difference between neighboring positive peak and
% negative peak voltage values.
%
% Input: X - ABR data (single traces) at one dB level.
%            Matrix of size (SAMPLES, m_traces) where columns are individual trace data.
% 
%         PEAK_THRESH (optional) - scalar for peak detection threshold. Default 0.50.
%
% Output: ind_peak - index of peak for peak-peak voltage in coherent average BR
%         ind_trough - index of lowest trough in coherent average BR
